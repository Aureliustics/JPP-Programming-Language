# JPP-Programming-Language
My attempt on creating an interpreted programming language called J++ made using Python (also an interpreted language) which gets interpreted by Skulpt on CodeHS. Triple layer interpretation ðŸ¤¯. Definitely very messy code but I just wanted to see if I could make it in such a restraining environment like CodeHS.
